# Infinite-Art-Gallery
3D Infinite Procedurally-Generated Art Gallery! This pulls from Reddit's r/Art and creates a procedural infinite art gallery from random (sfw-only) posts.

Rendered entirely with THREE.JS in the browser. (May) require a server couterpart to host and filter posts from the Reddit, Harvard Art Museum, and Met APIs.
